    "description": "I am fascinated by how RNA molecules and RNA-protein complexes work as dynamic molecular machines. My research sits at the intersection of biochemistry, structural biology, and molecular biology, where I aim to understand the mechanisms that underlie complex RNA-driven processes. \n\nI received my graduate training in biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). There, I became interested in RNA biology through my work on RNA helicases with Prof. Yunyu Shi. In 2018, I joined the Pyle Lab at Yale University for postdoctoral training. At Yale, I began exploring self-splicing introns, retrotransposons, and innate immune receptors, which lay the foundation of my future work. \n\nIn July 2026, I will start the Xu Lab at UF Scripps, where we will investigate the structure, dynamics, and function of RNA and RNA-protein assemblies. Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking and spending time with family and friends."
