    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p><strong>RNA structural biology</strong> –
      Our lab investigates the structure, dynamics, and regulatory mechanisms of RNA and RNA–protein complexes that govern genome integrity, innate immunity, and human health. 
      We combine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biochemistry, and RNA chemical probing to visualize how RNA molecules fold, assemble with proteins, and execute complex cellular functions. 
      By mapping these molecular interactions at high-resolution, we aim to uncover the fundamental principles that link RNA structure to biological activity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>RNA structures in disease</strong> –
      A central focus of our research is to elucidate how pathogenic RNAs contribute to disease. 
      We determine the structures and mechanisms of human LINE-1 retrotransposons, catalytic ribozymes, and long noncoding RNAs to reveal how their architectures drive genome mobility, catalysis, or regulation. 
      In parallel, we investigate innate immune RNA sensors and their recognition of viral or self-derived RNA, uncovering how these molecular sensors initiate antiviral responses. 
      Through these studies, we aim to define the structural logic that governs RNA recognition and regulation in health and disease.
    </p>
    <p><strong>RNA-targeted therapeutics</strong> – 
      Building on these mechanistic insights, our lab explores the potential of RNA as a druggable biomolecule. 
      We leverage high-resolution RNA structures to guide the rational design of small molecules that selectively modulate RNA function. 
      By integrating structure-guided design with biochemical and cellular assays, we seek to develop new therapeutic strategies targeting RNA-driven pathways and to establish a framework for discovering small molecules that control RNA structure and activity.
